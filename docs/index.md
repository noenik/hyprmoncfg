  tagline: A spatial layout editor, named profiles, automatic hotplug and lid switching, and workspace planning. From the terminal. No Python, no GTK, no nonsense.

features:
  - icon: 🖥️
    title: Spatial Layout Editor
    details: Drag monitors on a canvas, tweak mode, scale, VRR, mirror, and exact position in the inspector. See the result before you apply it.
  - icon: 🔌
    title: Hotplug and Lid-Aware Daemon
    details: Plug in a monitor, close the lid, and walk away. The daemon picks the best hardware profile and forces the internal laptop panel off when the lid is closed.
  - icon: 🔁
    title: Safe Apply with Revert
    details: Every apply writes monitors.conf atomically, reloads Hyprland, and verifies the result. A 10-second confirmation window means you never get locked out.
  - icon: 🗂️
    title: Workspace Planning
    details: Assign workspaces across monitors with sequential, interleave, or manual strategies. Stored inside each profile, applied together with the layout.
