## Layout editor

The layout tab is where you spend most of your time. It's split into two panes:

- **Left**: a spatial canvas showing your monitors as draggable rectangles
- **Right**: an inspector showing every property of the selected monitor

Drag monitors on the canvas to reposition them. The inspector updates in real time. When you need pixel-perfect placement, use the `Position X` and `Position Y` fields in the inspector.

![Layout editor]({{ '/assets/images/screenshots/layout.png' | relative_url }})
{: .screenshot }

### Main controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` `2` `3` | Switch tabs (layout, profiles, workspaces) |
| `a` | Apply current draft or selected profile |
| `s` | Save current draft as a named profile |
| `r` | Reset from live Hyprland state |
| `q` | Quit |

### Canvas controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Mouse drag | Move the selected monitor |
| Arrow keys | Move by 100px |
| `Shift` + arrows | Move by 10px |
| `Ctrl` + arrows | Move by 1px |
| `[` `]` | Cycle selected monitor |
| `Tab` | Switch focus between canvas and inspector |

Snap hints appear while dragging, but keyboard movement is freeform -- you're never forced into a grid.

### Inspector

Press `Enter` on any inspector field to edit it:

- **Mode** opens a scrollable picker with every supported resolution and refresh rate
- **Scale**, **Position X**, **Position Y** accept typed numeric values
- **Transform**, **VRR** cycle through their options with Enter or scroll
- **Mirror** lets you mirror the selected monitor to any other connected display. Set the Mode to match the source resolution for a crisp image -- mismatched resolutions cause Hyprland to upscale, which looks pixelated

## Save dialog

Press `s` from the layout tab. You'll see a text input and the list of existing profiles.

- Type to filter existing profiles
- Arrow keys to select one (overwrites after confirmation)
- Type a new name and press `Enter` to create a fresh profile

![Save profile dialog]({{ '/assets/images/screenshots/save-profile.png' | relative_url }})
{: .screenshot }

## Workspace planner

The third tab lets you distribute workspaces across monitors. Three strategies:

| Strategy | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `sequential` | Groups workspaces in chunks (e.g., 1-3 on monitor A, 4-6 on monitor B) |
| `interleave` | Round-robins workspaces across monitors (1 on A, 2 on B, 3 on A, ...) |
| `manual` | You define explicit rules for each workspace |

You can configure:

- Whether workspace rules are enabled at all
- Maximum workspace count
- Group size for sequential mode
- Monitor ordering

The workspace plan is stored inside each profile. When the daemon applies a profile, it applies workspace rules too -- layout and workspace assignment in one shot.
