## The problem with Hyprland monitor configuration

Configuring monitors in Hyprland means writing `monitor=` lines by hand. A 4K display at 1.33x scale is effectively 2880x1620 pixels, so the monitor next to it needs to start at x=2880. Vertically centering a 1080p panel against it means doing division in your head to get the y-offset right. You reload, you're off by 40 pixels, you edit, you reload again. There's no visual feedback until after you've committed to a config.

Then it gets worse. You unplug your laptop, go to a conference, plug into a projector, and you're back to editing config files backstage before your talk. You come home, dock the laptop, and the layout is wrong again.

Existing tools try to help but bring their own baggage: Python runtimes, GTK dependencies, fragile hotplug behavior. Some only do visual arrangement with no profiles. Others do profiles but have no editor. None of them verify that Hyprland is actually reading the file they're writing.

## What hyprmoncfg does differently

**It's terminal-first, not terminal-only.** The TUI has a real layout canvas with drag-and-drop, a per-monitor inspector, picker dialogs, and a workspace planner. It's not a glorified config editor -- it's a spatial tool that happens to run in your terminal.

**One apply engine, everywhere.** The TUI and the daemon use the exact same code path: write `monitors.conf` atomically, reload Hyprland, re-read monitor state, verify. No "best effort" daemon behavior. No silent failures.

**Profiles follow your hardware, not your ports.** Each profile stores monitor identity by make, model, and serial -- not by connector name. `DP-1` and `DP-2` can swap all they want. Your layout holds.

**It verifies the source chain.** Before writing anything, hyprmoncfg checks that `hyprland.conf` actually sources the target `monitors.conf`. Other tools skip this and silently update files that Hyprland never reads.

**One runtime dependency: Hyprland.** Two compiled Go binaries. No Python, no GTK, no GObject introspection, no D-Bus. Install them and you're done. They even work over SSH.
